A lightweight, framework-agnostic SCSS utility that provides responsive breakpoints and a pure CSS debug overlay to visualize the current breakpoint.

## Problem Solved

`screenshift` makes it easier to manage responsive styles by:

1.  Providing configurable SCSS variables/maps for common breakpoints.
2.  Offering a simple, pure CSS debug tool (activated via an HTML attribute) that displays the current breakpoint name, dimensions, and label without requiring JavaScript.

## Installation

Using Bun:

```bash
bun add screenshift
```
